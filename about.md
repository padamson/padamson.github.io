On these pages, I will provide background on my GitHub repositories. They are 
an eclectic bunch. For example:
* **ExotiMO**: simple code written in [Chapel](http://chapel.cray.com) to model 
chemical systems containing exotic particles (e.g. positrons) using 
Hartree-Fock (HF) and post-HF methods
* seamless: requirements, documentation, source code, and a test suite 
are all contained in your LaTeX document; encourages good software engineering 
practices, including a test-driven development approach
* screens: collection of stock screens written in Mathematica using Yahoo 
finance data and output to PDF using LaTeX
