[Paul](http://www.github.com/padamson)'s personal blog at [padamson.github.io](http://padamson.github.io).
It is built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted at [github](http://www.github.com). It's a random 
collection of notes on my work at the intersection of science, computer programming, machine learning, 
and project management.
