"Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful"
-- From George Box and Norman Draper, **Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces**, page 424.

"The recipe for perpetual ignorance is:
Be satisfied with your opinions and
content with your knowledge."
-- Elbert Hubbard, Businessman and writer. Author of the essay, **Message to Garcia**.

“Very few beings really seek knowledge in this world. Mortal or immortal, few 
really ask. On the contrary, they try to wring from the unknown the answers 
they have already shaped in their own minds -- justifications, confirmations, 
forms of consolation without which they can't go on. To really ask is to open 
the door to the whirlwind. The answer may annihilate the question and the 
questioner.” ―- Anne Rice, **The Vampire Lestat**
