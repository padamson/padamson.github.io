abstract: There's a lot of madness this March, both on and off the court. OpenAI continues to rock the tech world with every new release of its generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation model. To get in on the fun (***this is by no means a rigorous application of AI!***), I asked chatGPT to generate blurbs of actual and hypothetical matchups in the men's college basketball tournament (``March Madness'') as I filled out [my bracket][bracket].

## This really is just for fun

***ChatGPT knows nothing about the 2022-2023 men's college basketball season and certainly doesn't know what the 2023 March Madness bracket looks like.***

 --------

**Prompt:**

What is the latest data you are trained on?

 --------

**ChatGPT:**

I am trained on data up to September 2021.

 --------

## chatGPT wouldn't just fill out my bracket

***I tried a few different prompts to see if I could get chatGPT to just fill out my bracket, but I got responses like this:***

 --------

**Prompt:**

Write a blurb about every game in every round of the NCAA men's college basketball tournament. Identify the best players on each team, and include descriptions of their performance.

 --------

**ChatGPT:**

I'm sorry, as a language model, I cannot provide a response to this prompt as it would require an extensive amount of content creation, exceeding the scope of a single question. The NCAA Men's College Basketball Tournament consists of 68 teams playing multiple rounds, with each round consisting of numerous games. Providing a detailed blurb about every game in every round, along with descriptions of the best players on each team and their performances, would be beyond my capabilities.

However, I can provide you with information and strategies for writing about the NCAA tournament, including tips for identifying the best players, analyzing their performances, and crafting compelling blurbs. If you have specific questions or prompts related to the tournament, I'd be happy to assist you with those.

## South Region First Round

***I looped through the matchups in the bracket, asking for blurbs about each game. I experimented occasionally with changes to the prompt, only showing the new prompt once for each tweak.***

Kansas' big man, David McCormack, dominated in the paint, snagging rebounds and converting on numerous second-chance opportunities. But Howard's forward, Kyle Foster, was a force to be reckoned with, matching McCormack's intensity on both ends of the court.

Despite Kansas' talent, Howard refused to go down without a fight, and the game remained close throughout. In the end, it was Kansas' experience and depth that proved too much for Howard, as the Jayhawks pulled away in the second half for a hard-fought victory. Braun finished with a game-high 25 points, while McCormack added a double-double with 14 points and 11 rebounds. Maker led Howard with 21 points, while Foster contributed 16 points and 8 rebounds.

**ChatGPT:**

The NCAA tournament has been full of surprises so far, but nothing could have prepared us for the showdown between the Jayhawks of Kansas and the Razorbacks of Arkansas. Both teams have fought tooth and nail to make it this far, and it shows no signs of letting up now.

The first half was a back-and-forth affair, with neither team able to gain a significant advantage. Kansas guard Devon Dotson was having an impressive game, racking up points and assists while keeping the Razorbacks' defense on their toes. But Arkansas was not to be outdone, with guard Mason Jones matching Dotson shot for shot.

In the second half, Kansas started to pull away, thanks in no small part to the dominance of their big man Udoka Azubuike. The 7-foot center was a force to be reckoned with in the paint, grabbing rebounds and swatting shots left and right.

### Saint Mary and UCONN

***And we're back to hypothetical, highly anticipated games now...***

 --------

**ChatGPT:**

In this hypothetical NCAA tournament second round game, Saint Mary's and UCONN face off in a highly anticipated match-up. Both teams have had impressive seasons, but only one can move on to the Sweet 16. Saint Mary's relies heavily on their dynamic backcourt of Logan Johnson and Tommy Kuhse, who have been putting up big numbers all season. Johnson is a scoring machine, averaging over 17 points per game, while Kuhse is a master facilitator, averaging almost 6 assists per game. However, they will be going up against a tough UCONN defense led by James Bouknight, who has been one of the best guards in the country this season. Bouknight has been averaging over 19 points per game and can score from anywhere on the court.

In the frontcourt, Saint Mary's will look to Matthias Tass, who has been a dominant force in the paint, averaging over 10 rebounds per game. However, UCONN boasts a strong frontcourt of their own, with Isaiah Whaley and Adama Sanogo leading the way. Whaley has been a force on the defensive end, averaging over 2 blocks per game, while Sanogo has been a consistent presence in the paint, averaging almost 9 points and 6 rebounds per game.

### TCU and Gonzaga

 --------

**ChatGPT:**

In this hypothetical second round matchup, the TCU Horned Frogs would take on the Gonzaga Bulldogs in what promises to be an exciting game. TCU would rely heavily on the scoring prowess of their senior guard Mike Miles, who averaged 17.8 points per game during the regular season. Joining him in the backcourt would be junior guard PJ Fuller, who contributed 11.1 points per game and is known for his explosive athleticism. Up front, TCU would look to senior forward Kevin Samuel, who led the Big 12 in rebounding with 9.7 per game and also blocked 2.6 shots per game.

For Gonzaga, they would lean heavily on their star freshman guard Jalen Suggs, who has been one of the most exciting players in the country all season. Suggs averaged 14.3 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game, and his combination of scoring, playmaking, and defense makes him a potential lottery pick in the upcoming NBA draft. Joining him in the backcourt would be senior guard Andrew Nembhard, who is a steadying presence and can knock down shots from beyond the arc. In the frontcourt, Gonzaga would feature sophomore forward Drew Timme, who averaged 18.7 points and 7.1 rebounds per game and was one of the most efficient scorers in the country.

This game would likely be a high-scoring affair, with both teams featuring dynamic scoring guards and efficient big men. TCU would need to find a way to slow down Gonzaga's potent offense, while also getting enough production from their own supporting cast to keep pace. On the other hand, Gonzaga would need to withstand TCU's defensive pressure and rely on their balanced attack to advance to the Sweet 16.

Purdue, on the other hand, has relied on the dynamic duo of Jaden Ivey and Trevion Williams to carry them through tough games against top-tier teams.
