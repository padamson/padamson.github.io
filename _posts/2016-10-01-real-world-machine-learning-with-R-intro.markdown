## Abstract

{{ page.abstract }}

## Introducing [rwml-R](https://github.com/padamson/rwml-R)

The book "Real-World Machine Learning" attempts to prepare the reader for the 
realities of machine learning. It covers a basic framework for
machine-learning projects, then it dives into extended examples that show how 
that basic framework can be applied in realistic situations. It attempts to 
provide the "hidden wisdom" on how to go about implementing products and 
solutions based on machine learning. The book is a relatively easy read and
definitely worth the investment in time, but all of the supplied code is 
contained in 
iPython notebooks.  I'm working through the book, reproducing all of the code 
listings and figures using R markdown, and I'm posting 
the results in a github repo: [rwml-R](https://github.com/padamson/rwml-R).

## Example: Mosaic Plot in Figure 2.12

To reproduce the mosaic plot in Figure 2.12 of the book, I use the [vcd][vcd] 
package which contains a plethora of excellent tools for exploring categorical
data. The below mosaic plot shows the relationship between passenger gender 
and survival in the supplied Titanic Passengers dataset.
